ABSTRACT
This study focuses on developing an application that lets users order their foods online for FEU Alabang food concessionaires, namely R2K, CIA, and Graciously respectively. This application will be used as a food ordering app but users will still go to the chosen 
food stall to collect their food. To build the app, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and Wireframe will be used here and MySQL as our database to store the food stall ownerâ€™s meals and employees. Waiting in line for too long is a pain-stalking task especially when
someone is hungry and waiting is the last thing they want to deal with. Queuing can lead to several negatives like the missed opportunities for revenue because of the loss of some customers when looking at an intimidatingly long line that begs the question why are 
they lining up in the first place That is why this application will not completely eliminate queue lines but rather makes the queue faster since they will only collect their foods in their chosen food store.
