Abstract<br>
This study focuses on developing an application that lets users order their foods online for FEU Alabang food concessionaires, namely R2K, CIA, and Graciously respectively. This application will be used as a food ordering app but users will still go to the chosen 
food stall to collect their food. To build the app, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and Wireframe will be used here and MySQL as our database to store the food stall owner’s meals and employees. Waiting in line for too long is a pain-stalking task especially when
someone is hungry and waiting is the last thing they want to deal with. Queuing can lead to several negatives like the missed opportunities for revenue because of the loss of some customers when looking at an intimidatingly long line that begs the question why are 
they lining up in the first place That is why this application will not completely eliminate queue lines but rather makes the queue faster since they will only collect their foods in their chosen food store.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The study will be beneficial to future researchers since the application is open-source they can improve the application such as adding a dynamic way to add new stores to the alabites service or conduct further research in other designated branches of the food concessionaires in other schools in Alabang but this is not limited to them, other food businesses can also try out the application.. 

Adding the food delivery system of the application will also be beneficial not only for the future researchers but also for the food concessionaires so that they can expand their business across Alabang. Other users who own a food business can use the application in order to provide the customers with a wider range of food stalls to choose from. With adding and improving to the application with a food delivery system and the feature to add new stores can be implemented by future researchers, this allows to expand the food stall owners’ customer base and attract new customers in Alabang.
